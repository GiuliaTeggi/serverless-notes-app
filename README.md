# Serverless Notes App

A note-taking application with auth0 authentication built on AWS using the serverless framework.

I am building this app to learn more about serverless and AWS services. I'm also trying out Material UI for the first time, so I can compare it to Semantic UI React which I have more experience with.

ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§

Currently working on: allowing notes editing and image upload via AWS S3.
